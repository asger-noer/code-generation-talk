# Write less code, be more effective

Have you ever been knees deep writing http handlers or database interface, and
just wishing someone else would have saved you sanity from that?

We all strive to be as efficient as possible. Yet, some of our daily tasks as
developers can be quite boring and time-consuming. When those two words are in
the same sentence, that is a pretty strong hint that a workflow can be
optimised. This talk aim to show junior to intermediate level engineers, how to
leverage the Go toolchain to write less code and be more efficient by harvesting
the fruits of code generation.
